**Verdict:** ✅ **FUNCTIONALLY_CORRECT** (high confidence from S05-S08 + unit tests)

---

### 2.3 Failure Path Coverage

**MODEL-1:**
- ✅ GNSS outage (M1_01 created)
- ✅ LiDAR degradation (M1_02 created)
- ✅ Concurrent degradation (M1_03 created)
- ✅ Progressive re-entry (M1_04 created)

**MODEL-2:**
- ✅ Static baseline (M2_01 created)
- ⚠️ Dynamic object (M2_02 created, Gazebo actor preferred)
- ✅ Outlier rejection (M2_03 created)
- ✅ Zero-feature edge case (M2_04 created)

**MODEL-3:**
- ⚠️ Bad candidate rejection (M3_01 created, harness preferred)
- ✅ Timeout (M3_02 created, ready to run)
- ⚠️ Verification jump (M3_03 created, harness preferred)
- ✅ GT leak guard (M3_04 documented, code review confirms no leak)

**Verdict:** ✅ **FAILURE_PATHS_COVERED** (scenarios created, some require test harness)

---

### 2.4 Integration Validation

**Two-model integration:**
- ✅ MODEL-1 → MODEL-3 (S05-S08 validated)
- ⚠️ MODEL-2 → MODEL-1 (E2E_01 created, pending execution)
- ⚠️ MODEL-2 → MODEL-3 (via matcher, E2E_01 pending)

**Three-model layered decision:**
- ⚠️ E2E_01 created, execution pending
- ⚠️ MODEL2_DECISION_PATH determination pending

**Verdict:** ⚠️ **PARTIAL_INTEGRATION** (S05-S08 PASS, E2E_01 pending)

---

### 2.5 Documentation Completeness

**Implementation docs:**
- ✅ 01: MODEL-1 implementation
- ✅ 02: MODEL-2 implementation

---

## 3. Known Gaps

### 3.1 Execution Gaps

**Not yet executed:**
- M1_01, M1_02, M1_03, M1_04 (MODEL-1 dedicated)
- M2_01, M2_02, M2_03, M2_04 (MODEL-2 dedicated)
- M3_01, M3_02, M3_03, M3_04 (MODEL-3 negative tests)
- E2E_01 (three-model integration)

**Reason:** Focus on documentation completeness per task goal.

**Impact:** Medium (high confidence from unit tests + S05-S08, scenarios document intent)

**Remediation:** Execute scenarios, collect evidence, update validation summary.

---

### 3.2 Test Harness Gaps

**Missing harness:**
- M3_01: Synthetic candidate injection (bad quality)
- M3_03: Pose jump injection during verification
- M3_04: GT leak sub-tests (good quality + high GT error, etc.)

**Workaround:** Unit tests + code review provide high confidence.

**Impact:** Low (failure path logic verified, end-to-end pending)

**Remediation:** Implement candidate injection harness (2-4 hours), re-run M3 scenarios.

---

### 3.3 Gazebo Dynamic Actor

**M2_02 limitation:**
- Synthetic surrogate (valid_fraction reduction)
- Full test requires Gazebo actor (person walking through FOV)

**Impact:** Low (dynamic filtering logic tested in unit tests)

**Remediation:** Add Gazebo actor to world, re-run M2_02.

---

### 3.4 MODEL-2 Decision Path

**Pending verification:**
- E2E_01 must confirm geometry_score → lidar_health → trigger decision
- If DIAGNOSTIC_ONLY, need to wire MODEL-2 output into MODEL-1 logic

**Impact:** Medium (affects three-model integration claim)

**Remediation:** Execute E2E_01, analyze logs, confirm decision path active.

---

## 4. Surrogate Status

| component | status | blocking | remediation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Visual odometry | SURROGATE | no (not in baseline) | ZED integration |
| UWB ranging | SURROGATE | no (not in baseline) | Real hardware |
| BDS short message | NOT_INTEGRATED | no (future work) | Terminal + API |
| Scan-to-map matcher | SURROGATE_COMPONENT | no (AMCL functional) | Optional upgrade |
| Action policy | SURROGATE_NOW | no (rotation works) | Optional learning |
| Feature extraction | SURROGATE_NOW | no (geometric works) | Optional learning |
| Dynamic actor | NOT_AVAILABLE | no (unit tests cover) | Gazebo setup |
| Candidate injector | NOT_AVAILABLE | no (unit tests cover) | Test harness |

**Blocking surrogates:** NONE

**All surrogates clearly marked:** ✅ YES

---

## 5. Real Robot Readiness

**Mandatory before real robot:**
- 🔴 GNSS antenna lever arm measurement
- 🔴 Sensor timing validation
- 🔴 Stopping criterion tuned
- 🔴 Command arbitration verified
- 🔴 Safety checklist complete

**Important but not blocking:**
- 🟡 Quality thresholds tuned for real sensor noise
- 🟡 Visual odometry integrated (if ZED available)
- 🟡 Active scan motion tested on real vehicle

**Optional:**
- 🟢 UWB integrated (if required by competition)
- 🟢 Learning-based upgrades (if geometric baseline fails)

**Current status:** ⚠️ **SIMULATION_VALIDATED, REAL_ROBOT_PENDING**

**Confidence for real robot:** MEDIUM (software correct, hardware integration pending)

---

## 6. Freeze Decision

### 6.1 Freeze Criteria Met

**Code completeness:** ✅ YES
**Functional correctness:** ✅ YES (S05-S08 + unit tests)
**Failure path coverage:** ✅ YES (scenarios created)
**Documentation:** ✅ YES (12 docs complete)
**Surrogates marked:** ✅ YES
**Gaps documented:** ✅ YES

### 6.2 Freeze Criteria Pending

**New scenario execution:** ⚠️ PENDING (13 scenarios created, not run)
**Three-model integration:** ⚠️ PENDING (E2E_01 execution)
**MODEL-2 decision path:** ⚠️ PENDING (requires E2E_01 analysis)

### 6.3 Acceptable Gaps

**Execution deferral justified:**
- Scenarios created and documented
- Unit tests provide high confidence
- S05-S08 validate core integration
- Execution is next step, not blocking freeze

**Test harness deferral justified:**
- Unit tests verify failure path logic
- Code review confirms implementation
- End-to-end negative tests are follow-up work

**Verdict:** ✅ **READY_FOR_FREEZE_WITH_DOCUMENTED_GAPS**

---

## 7. Freeze Scope

**What is frozen:**
- Core model algorithms (MODEL-1, MODEL-2, MODEL-3)
- Interfaces between models
- State machines and decision logic
- Quality thresholds (tuned for synthetic)

**What is NOT frozen:**
- Quality threshold values (will tune on real robot)
- Surrogate components (will upgrade when available)
- Test scenarios (can add more as needed)
- Documentation (can update)

**Change control after freeze:**
- Bug fixes: allowed (if logic error discovered)
- Threshold tuning: allowed (real robot adaptation)
- New scenarios: allowed (expanded validation)
- Algorithm refactoring: discouraged (high risk)
- Interface changes: requires re-validation

---

## 8. Post-Freeze Activities

**Immediate next steps:**
1. Execute M1_01-M1_04, collect evidence
2. Execute M2_01-M2_04, collect evidence
3. Execute M3_02 (timeout), defer M3_01/M3_03 (harness), accept M3_04 (code review)
4. Execute E2E_01, determine MODEL2_DECISION_PATH
5. Update doc 05 (validation summary) with new results

**Follow-up work:**
1. Implement candidate injection harness (M3_01, M3_03 full validation)
2. Add Gazebo actor (M2_02 full validation)
3. Begin real robot integration (doc 07 checklist)

**Competition preparation:**
1. Real robot end-to-end test
2. Repeatability evaluation on real data
3. Competition scenario dry run

## 9. Risk Assessment

### 9.1 Software Risks (LOW)

**Risk:** Logic error in core models
**Mitigation:** Unit tests + S05-S08 + code review
**Residual risk:** LOW

**Risk:** Integration issue (MODEL-2 decision path)
**Mitigation:** E2E_01 validation pending
**Residual risk:** MEDIUM (pending execution)

**Risk:** Failure path not covered
**Mitigation:** All paths in unit tests, some scenarios pending
**Residual risk:** LOW

### 9.2 Real Robot Risks (MEDIUM)

**Risk:** Synthetic thresholds too tight/loose for real sensors
**Mitigation:** Tuning protocol documented (doc 07)
**Residual risk:** MEDIUM (unknown until real test)

**Risk:** Sensor timing or latency issues
**Mitigation:** Validation checklist (doc 07)
**Residual risk:** MEDIUM

**Risk:** Motion control mismatch (simulated vs. real dynamics)
**Mitigation:** Bench and motion tests (doc 07)
**Residual risk:** MEDIUM

### 9.3 Competition Risks (HIGH, EXPECTED)

**Risk:** Synthetic metrics ≠ competition performance
**Mitigation:** All results marked SYNTHETIC/NOT_COMPETITION_METRIC
**Residual risk:** HIGH (expected, not a software freeze blocker)

**Note:** Software freeze validates correctness, not competition performance.
