## 1. Overview

MODEL-2 implements stable feature extraction from 2D LiDAR scans under dynamic and
abnormal reflection conditions. It filters dynamic objects, detects outliers, and
maintains temporal consistency to provide stable features for scan matching and
localization.

## 2. Core Component

### 2.1 lidar_robust_features.py (329 lines)

**Purpose:** Extract static, stable features from raw LiDAR scans by filtering
dynamic content and abnormal reflections.

**Processing pipeline:**
```
raw scan
  ↓
preprocessing (range validation, angle limits)
  ↓
dynamic / abnormal candidate detection
  ↓
static candidate extraction
  ↓
temporal persistence filtering
  ↓
stable candidate output
  ↓
one-to-one matching (if map available)
  ↓
repeatability evaluation
```

## 3. Feature Extraction Strategy

### 3.1 Geometric Consistency (First Version)

Since 2D LiDAR data limits complex learning models, current implementation uses
engineering-based geometric methods:

**Range discontinuity detection:**
- Identify sharp range jumps between adjacent beams
- Flag potential object boundaries
- Distinguish foreground/background edges

**Local curvature analysis:**
- Compute point-to-point angle changes
- High curvature → corners, edges
- Low curvature → planar surfaces, walls

**Temporal persistence:**
- Track point occupancy across multiple scans
- Reject points that appear/disappear rapidly
- Retain points stable over N consecutive scans

**Robust outlier rejection:**
- Statistical outlier removal (distance-based)
- Median filtering for noisy ranges
- Isolation forest for abnormal clusters (if sufficient compute)

### 3.2 Dynamic Object Filtering

**Method:**
- Maintain temporal occupancy grid or point history
- Points that move between scans → dynamic candidates
- Points static over persistence_window → static candidates

**Parameters:**
- `persistence_window`: minimum scan count for stability (default: 3-5)
- `motion_threshold`: maximum allowed point displacement (default: 0.1 m)

### 3.3 Abnormal Reflection Handling

**Types addressed:**
- Specular reflections (glass, metal)
- Multi-path returns
- Range outliers (far beyond expected)
- Beam occlusion artifacts

**Detection:**
- Isolated points (no neighbors within radius)
- Range jumps exceeding physical plausibility
- Intensity anomalies (if available from LiDAR)

## 4. Repeatability Evaluation

### 4.1 Metrics Implemented

Following frozen protocol:

```
R_min:              minimum repeatability across all pairs
R_avg:              average repeatability
R_pool:             pooled repeatability across all valid pairs
valid_pair_count:   number of pairs with non-zero features
zero_feature_pair_count: pairs where either scan had zero features
retention_static:   fraction of points classified static
retention_stable:   fraction of static points that are also stable
```

**Repeatability definition:**
```
R = 2 * matched_pairs / (features_scan1 + features_scan2)
```

### 4.2 Evaluation Context

```
SIMULATION_DIAGNOSTIC_ONLY
```

Repeatability scores computed in synthetic/Gazebo scenarios are for software
validation, NOT competition metrics. Real-world repeatability requires:
- Real LiDAR hardware noise characteristics
- Real dynamic environments (people, vehicles)
- Real surface materials and lighting
- Real scan matching against surveyed map

## 5. Integration with MODEL-1 and MODEL-3

### 5.1 Quality Input to MODEL-1

LiDAR geometry score computed by MODEL-2:

**Factors:**
- Angular diversity (scan FOV coverage)
- Point count (sufficient features)
- Stable feature ratio (dynamic filtering effectiveness)
- Range distribution (not all points at max range)

**Output:**
- `geometry_score`: 0.0 (unusable) … 1.0 (ideal)
- Published to MODEL-1 for health assessment

**Degradation trigger:**
- geometry_score < min_lidar_quality → LIDAR_QUALITY_LOW
- Sustained low quality → MODEL-1 escalates to DEGRADED
- Combined with other failures → triggers MODEL-3

### 5.2 Feature Input to MODEL-3

Stable features used by MODEL-3 scan-to-map matcher:

**Flow:**
1. MODEL-2 extracts stable features from current scan
2. MODEL-3 active scan phase requests segments
3. MODEL-2 provides stable points per segment
4. Scan-to-map matcher uses stable features only
5. Match quality fed back to MODEL-1

## 6. Synthetic Validation

### 6.1 Implicit Coverage in S05-S08

**S05 Phase 2: LIDAR_GEOMETRY_DEGRADED**
- Angular window restricted: -0.18 … +0.18 rad (±10°)
- geometry_score drops, but scan remains valid
- Tests narrow FOV handling

**S06-S08: Active scan segments**
- Rotation generates new viewpoints
- Stable features extracted per segment
- Match quality evaluated

### 6.2 Missing Explicit MODEL-2 Scenarios

❌ **Static baseline:**
- Stationary robot, static environment
- All features should be stable
- Verify zero false dynamic detections

❌ **Dynamic object injection:**
- Simulated person/vehicle moving through scan
- Verify dynamic points rejected
- Stable background retained

❌ **Outlier/reflection injection:**
- Abnormal ranges, multi-path
- Verify outlier rejection
- Feature count remains reasonable

❌ **Zero-feature edge case:**
- Empty environment or max-range scan
- Verify graceful handling (no crash)
- Repeatability correctly reports zero

## 7. Unit Tests

```
src/ylhb_base/test/test_lidar_robust_features.py
```

**Coverage:**
- Range validation
- Angle limits
- Discontinuity detection
- Persistence filtering
- Repeatability computation
- Zero-feature handling

**Run:**
```bash
colcon test --packages-select ylhb_base --pytest-args "-k lidar_robust"
```

## 8. Known Limitations

### 8.1 Current Implementation

**Engineering-based, not learning-based:**
- Uses geometric heuristics (curvature, discontinuity, persistence)
- No trained neural network
- No semantic segmentation

**Justification:**
- 2D LiDAR data insufficient for complex learning
- Geometric methods provide interpretable, tunable baseline
- Can upgrade to learning when 3D data or sufficient training corpus available

**Marked as:**
```
FINAL_ALGORITHM_LATER (for learning-based approach)
SURROGATE_NOW (geometric baseline)
```

### 8.2 Synthetic Limitations

**Analytic scan waveform (S05):**
- Not real LiDAR geometry
- Tests geometry_score path, not scan matching accuracy

**Gazebo LiDAR model:**
- Simplified ray-tracing
- No specular reflections or multi-path
- No intensity data

**Dynamic objects:**
- Gazebo actors/models available but not yet used in scenarios
- Dynamic filtering tested in unit tests, not end-to-end scenarios

## 9. Repeatability Guard

**Critical requirement:**
```
DO_NOT_DELETE_ALL_FEATURES_FOR_HIGH_REPEATABILITY
```

If stable feature extraction is too aggressive, scan becomes empty:
- Repeatability artificially high (zero features → R undefined or 1.0 by convention)
- Localization fails (no features to match)

**Safeguard:**
- Minimum feature count threshold
- If filtering removes > 90% of points, relax criteria
- Log warning if zero-feature condition reached

## 10. Real Robot Follow-up

Before real hardware:

1. ❌ **Tune persistence window** for real LiDAR update rate
2. ❌ **Calibrate motion threshold** for real odometry noise
3. ❌ **Test with real dynamic objects** (people walking through scene)
4. ❌ **Validate outlier rejection** on real materials (glass, metal, wet surfaces)
5. ❌ **Benchmark repeatability** on surveyed test course
6. ❌ **Integrate intensity data** if LiDAR provides it

## 11. Summary

**MODEL-2 status:**
- ✅ Core feature extraction implemented
- ✅ Dynamic filtering and outlier rejection working
- ✅ Repeatability evaluation chain complete
- ✅ Interface to MODEL-1 (geometry_score) validated
- ✅ Interface to MODEL-3 (stable features) working
- ❌ Missing dedicated test scenarios (static, dynamic, outliers, zero-feature)
- ❌ Geometric baseline explicitly marked as SURROGATE_NOW

**Next steps:**
- Create MODEL-2 specific test scenarios
- Run scenarios with dynamic object injection
